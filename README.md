# star-list

`star-list` is a curated repository catalog plus a small Python toolchain for selecting projects for a task, monitoring catalog health, finding coverage gaps, discovering candidates, and reviewing changes before they enter the catalog.

The repository is intentionally data-first: `catalog.json` is the source catalog, `catalog.schema.json` defines its structure, and the scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts/) validate, rank, analyze, refresh, and review that data.

Current stable release: **1.0.0**. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## What it does

- validates the catalog and its metadata;
- recommends repositories for a natural-language task with technical constraints;
- scores repository health and tracks trends over time;
- detects weak catalog coverage and searches GitHub for candidates;
- evaluates candidates as `accept`, `review`, or `reject` without adding them automatically;
- remembers unchanged review/reject candidates to reduce repeated noise;
- validates generated JSON against contracts in [`schemas/`](schemas/);
- opens or updates GitHub issues for discovery, cache health, and repository health review.

## Requirements

The local toolchain targets **Python 3.12** and uses the Python standard library. No package installation is required for the validation, recommendation, scoring, or offline integration tests.

Clone the repository and run commands from its root directory.

## Quick start

Validate the catalog:

```bash
python scripts/validate_catalog.py
```

Find repositories for a task:

```bash
python scripts/recommend.py "xauusd backtesting risk execution" --top 8
python scripts/recommend.py "local coding agent" --self-hosted --max-complexity medium
python scripts/recommend.py "python trading backtest" --language python --cap backtesting --json
```

Run the end-to-end pipeline test without network access:

```bash
python scripts/test_pipeline_integration.py
```

For all recommender flags and examples, see [`RECOMMENDER.md`](RECOMMENDER.md).

| `CHANGELOG.md` | Stable release notes. |
| `catalog.json` | Curated repository catalog. |

| [`schemas/`](schemas/) | JSON contracts for generated and persistent pipeline outputs. |
| [`.github/workflows/validate.yml`](.github/workflows/validate.yml) | CI validation pipeline. |

## Pipeline architecture

The discovery path is:

```text
catalog.json
   |
   v
analyze_coverage.py
   |
   v
build_discovery_watchlist.py
   |
   v
discover_candidates.py  <--> discovery-cache.json
   |
   v
evaluate_candidates.py
   |
   v
filter_discovery_memory.py <--> discovery-memory.json
   |
   v
render_discovery_issue.py
   |
   v
GitHub discovery review issue
```

The important separation is deliberate:

1. **Coverage** decides what the catalog is missing.
2. **Discovery** searches for repositories that may fill those gaps.
3. **Evaluation** applies activity, fit, adoption, maturity, and maintenance signals.
4. **Memory** suppresses unchanged non-accepted candidates on later runs.
5. **Rendering** produces review material; candidates are never inserted into `catalog.json` automatically.

The detailed candidate scoring and confidence model is documented in [`docs/DISCOVERY_SCORING.md`](docs/DISCOVERY_SCORING.md).

## Recommendation engine

`scripts/recommend.py` ranks existing catalog entries for a concrete task. Its **selection score** is task-specific and is distinct from both the catalog quality score and discovery candidate evaluation score.

It considers capability/domain/task matches, `bestFor`, catalog quality, tier, activity, repository health, trend history, and `avoidWhen` penalties. It can also enforce platform, language, self-hosting, resource, complexity, capability, archive, and minimum-score constraints.

See [`RECOMMENDER.md`](RECOMMENDER.md) for command examples and supported filters.

## Discovery scoring

Candidate admission uses two stages:

- `discoveryScore` is produced by GitHub discovery and represents search/discovery relevance and repository signals;
- `evaluationScore` starts from that value and applies deterministic admission adjustments.

The current admission thresholds are `accept >= 80`, `review >= 55`, otherwise `reject`. A candidate with `low` metadata confidence cannot be auto-accepted even if its numeric score reaches the accept threshold; it is capped at `review`.

See [`docs/DISCOVERY_SCORING.md`](docs/DISCOVERY_SCORING.md) for the exact adjustments, confidence signals, and diagnostic score breakdown.

## Validation and tests

The CI workflow compiles all Python utilities, validates the catalog, runs component tests, validates JSON contracts, executes the offline end-to-end discovery integration test, checks documentation consistency, and validates generated reports.

Useful local checks:

```bash
python -m compileall -q scripts
python scripts/validate_catalog.py
python scripts/test_recommend.py
python scripts/test_evaluate_candidates.py
python scripts/test_json_contracts.py
python scripts/test_pipeline_integration.py
python scripts/test_documentation.py
```

`python scripts/test_pipeline_integration.py` covers the complete offline chain `coverage -> watchlist -> discovery -> evaluation -> memory -> issue rendering` with deterministic mocked GitHub responses.

## Automated metadata refresh

The **Refresh GitHub metadata** workflow in [`.github/workflows/refresh-metadata.yml`](.github/workflows/refresh-metadata.yml) runs every Monday at `04:17 UTC` and can also be started with `workflow_dispatch`.

It refreshes repository metadata, validates the catalog, updates health/history state, runs discovery, validates every pipeline JSON contract, analyzes cache health, maintains review issues, and commits changed persistent state back to the repository.

The workflow writes or maintains these persistent files:

```text
catalog.json
health-snapshot.json
history.json
discovery-cache.json
discovery-memory.json
cache-health-history.json
```

GitHub API access is supplied by the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`; local recommendation and offline tests do not require a token.

## JSON contracts

Generated pipeline outputs are checked against the contracts under [`schemas/`](schemas/) using `scripts/validate_json_contract.py`. The validator implements the JSON Schema keywords currently used by this repository; it is intentionally a focused validator rather than a general-purpose implementation of every JSON Schema 2020-12 keyword.

Example:

```bash
python scripts/validate_json_contract.py schemas/discovery-evaluated.schema.json discovery-evaluated.json
```

## Safety model for catalog changes

Automated discovery is advisory. It can find, score, remember, and surface candidates, but it does **not** edit `catalog.json` to add a repository. Human review remains the admission boundary.
